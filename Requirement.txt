To run the website, you can follow these steps:

1.Make sure you have Python installed on your system. And all the project files  have been saved locally.

2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your dish_search_app project.

3.If you're using a virtual environment, activate it by running the appropriate command based on your operating system. For example, on Windows, you can use the following command: 
-> venv\Scripts\activate

4.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
-> pip install -r requirements.txt

5.Once the dependencies are installed, you need to apply any database migrations. Run the following command to apply migrations:
-> python manage.py migrate

6.Start the development server by running the following command:
-> python manage.py runserver

7.Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
->http://localhost:8000/search



Note: Make sure to replace localhost with the appropriate hostname or IP address if you're running the website on a remote server or if the Django development server is configured to use a different host.
